  In addition to the research, during my university days I had some experiences related to teaching and education.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  First, I had the pleasure to help more than 10 students as private teacher at first courses university level, mainly in subjects related to maths. Teaching is one of the things I enjoy the most in life, specially with students who work hard, and just need someone to take their hand and make them think the proper questions. Because usually they already know the answers, and I don&#8217;t try to be a guru, but just a guide to unveil their potential. I am so glad of having helped many students to deal with subjects in the areas of maths, engineering, and computer science, but also learning to play the guitar.

  I also had the opportunity to serve as teaching assistant for the Pattern Recognition course. This optative module, which I took when being a student, allows telecom students to have a vision of many applications of their knowledge to practical problems. At the same time, Machine Learning and Data Science has been my occupation since I finished my PhD.

  Finally, in the context of the European Project <a href="http://www.ict-tucan3g.eu/">TUCAN3G</a>, I supervisedÂ during several months a group of students (see the pic in the PhD section) for the development of a network planning tool for rural areas. In this case, I acted as the link between my PhD advisor, the project coordinator, and the students developing the tool.
