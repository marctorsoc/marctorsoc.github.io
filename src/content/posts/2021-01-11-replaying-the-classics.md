Today I bring something I learnt during my Christmas holidays, bringing a bit of 
nostalgia to my life. Thanks to [Open Emu](https://openemu.org/), it is now
easier than ever to revive your childhood videogames.

Disclaimer: this only works for Mac!

There are many consoles available, see the list on the website. Here I am just going to add
 some links, and I'm sure you'll know how to use them wisely :)

* [Controller](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07QQSGY7P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Note 
that this is the one I got, but the originals seem to work better

Don't hesitate to ask me if you cannot make it work. Have fun!
