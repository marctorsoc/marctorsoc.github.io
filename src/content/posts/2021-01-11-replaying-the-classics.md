Today I bring something I learned during my Christmas holidays, bringing a bit of 
nostalgia to my life. Thanks to [Open Emu](https://openemu.org/), it is now
easier than ever to revive your childhood videogames.

Disclaimer: this works for Mac only!

There are many consoles available, see the list on the website. Here I am just going to add
 some links, and I'm sure you'll know how to use them wisely :)

that this is the one I got, but the originals seem to work better

And that's it. Have fun!
