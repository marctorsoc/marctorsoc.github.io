<p style="text-align: justify;"> For a group 
of data scientists remotely working together, not only but also within a private 
company, it is very useful to have some space a) to meet periodically, 
 and b) just for fresh air. 
 </p>

A Journal club is 
 one of those initiatives that helps in this regard. We started this in 
 Globality since I joined (thanks to my previous manager Pokey), and it's a good 
 opportunity for someone in the team to explore some parallel topic, and a bit of a 
 playground. At the same time, it allows the group to learn together, explore 
 new ideas in the research community, and discuss how to apply them to our 
 team objectives.

In this page, I collected some the 
[talks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FKblUDZb4K0yjM749X8z3YUGT6wWh5mv?usp=sharing)
