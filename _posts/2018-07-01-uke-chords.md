  I love music. I would say is in my top 3 passions in life, and learning to play a song
  is something that makes me feel really proud. I've played the guitar for almost
  15 years, and even though I'm not a good guitarist I would say I'm good enough for someone who has no idea to think I master it 😆

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Recently, I came up with the idea of started learning ukelele, with the objective of
  bringing music with me when I travel, as usually you can bring this little instrument
  at no extra cost. So I looked for a second hand ukelele and found this precious little
  one:

  In this process of learning, even though I'm coming from guitar I developed
  and found some resources, and I think could be useful for anyone else out there,
  so let's share! here you have a table I have compiled based on other sources
  and collecting the more typical chords:

  As you can see, I have selected only some of the many many chords you can do. Also,
  I give below a small list of some covers that have been useful and inspiration
   for learning more. Enjoy!
