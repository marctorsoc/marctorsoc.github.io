  In this section, I will post different resources that may be useful in your undergrad days, at work, or preparing a job interview. You will review something from the past, or maybe learn something new. I will includeÂ my findings in data science, coding, and maths.

  I also keep notes about different topics in the form of Google Slides presentations:

  * <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1abzvRA6VQyMPIfuLVh43QgDdgH-7XgnfE7v73kxNYWw/edit?usp=sharing">Machine Learning</a>
  * <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14B0zzok1l1Zl-lUTigtAKubvBdVwBQfxhh1XWADHCRo/edit?usp=sharing">NLP</a>
  * <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EhUGzJlXeU0T1RZiDByrt9szTwanSFvTtFziHTyVFCk/edit?usp=sharing">Algorithms and coding</a>
  * <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ugNBNu3AcacuTo5aGWleNnYK5JqrubO_AUpDDRh-yWM/edit?usp=sharing">Maths</a>

These do not pretend to be exhaustive and are (and will always be) in construction.  I update them many times a month, as I find out new concepts, properties, or even better ways to explain things.
